# Problems
## Day 1
1. Find the number of 1s in an integer.
2. Write a program to find the prime number in the most efficient way.
3. There is a 1-d array of n size, and it should have elements starting from 1 up to its size in a random order. Let’s assume now that one element has been removed from somewhere, find the number which is removed and from which index.
4. You are a station master and you have 2 lists with you. One list is having the arrival time of all trains and other list has the departure timings of all the trains passing from that station. Can you find out the number of platforms required?
5. There is a 1-d array of size n and it has 0’s, 1’s and 2’s randomly distributed. Can you arrange all 0’s , 1’s and 2’s together iterating the array only once.

## Day 2

6. Find the nth Fibonacci number.
7. Given two strings find the longest common subsequence
8. Given an array of n numbers, find a contiguous subsequence for which the sum of the elements is maximum. 
9. Given an array of n numbers, find a contiguous subsequence for which the sum of the elements is maximum. Condition being you can not select two contiguous numbers.
10. Given an array of n numbers, find a contiguous subsequence for which the sum of the elements is maximum. Condition being you can not select three contiguous numbers.
